Cloudinary Product Recommendation App
======================================================

This is a Flask-based application that uses Cloudinary's API for image management, tagging, and generating image recommendations based on user-selected content.

## Features

* **Image Upload**: Automatically uploads images from a local directory to Cloudinary, tagging them with AI-powered categorization (AWS Rekognition).
* **Dynamic Recommendations**: Suggests additional images based on shared tags with user-selected images.
* **Optimized Image Display**:
  * Images are transformed dynamically for consistent quality and format.
  * Delivered via Cloudinaryâ€™s CDN for optimal performance.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**:
    * Images in the `Images` directory are uploaded to Cloudinary with auto-tagging enabled.
    * Images are stored in a `tagged_images` folder with relevant tags.
2. **Homepage (/)**:
    * Displays up to 10 uploaded images.
    * Users can select images to receive recommendations.
3. **Recommendations Page (/output)**:
    * Based on selected images, the app analyzes tags and suggests similar images.
